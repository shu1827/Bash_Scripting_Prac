###############################################################################################
The error you're encountering indicates that the CentOS 7 base repository is no longer available at the URL you're trying to access. This can happen if the repository has been moved, or support for your CentOS version has ended.
To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:
1. Switch to Vault Repository
CentOS 7's older repositories are moved to the CentOS Vault. You can switch your repository URLs to point to the Vault repositories. To do this:

1.Backup your existing repository files:
bash
Copy code
sudo cp /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo.bak

2.Edit the /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo

3.Replace all instances of mirror.centos.org with vault.centos.org. For example:
bash
Copy code
[base]
name=CentOS-7 - Base
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/os/$basearch/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7

4.Save the changes and run:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum update

2.Use Alternative Mirrors
Sometimes the CentOS mirror system may not function correctly. You can try to update the mirror list manually:
1.Open the repository file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo

2.Replace the mirrorlist= lines with a specific mirror's URL in the baseurl= field. You can find alternative CentOS mirrors here.

3.Upgrade to CentOS Stream or CentOS 8
If CentOS 7 is not meeting your needs, you could consider upgrading to CentOS Stream (rolling-release) or CentOS 8 (though support for CentOS 8 has also ended as of December 2021, CentOS Stream is its successor).

One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown), and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this: 

The error you're encountering suggests that one of the repositories configured in your system is either unavailable or misconfigured, causing yum to fail when trying to install or update packages. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:
Steps to Fix the Error:
1.Clear the Yum Cache: Sometimes, corrupted or outdated cache files cause problems. You can try clearing the Yum cache with the following command:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum clean all

2.Disable the Problematic Repository: If you know which repository is causing the issue, you can temporarily disable it:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum --disablerepo=<repository_name> update
Replace <repository_name> with the name of the repository causing the issue (you can find the name in the error message).

3.Check for Repo Configuration Errors: You may want to inspect the repository configuration files located in /etc/yum.repos.d/. You can check them manually:
bash
Copy code
ls /etc/yum.repos.d/
Then, open and inspect the relevant .repo file. If a repository is misconfigured, correct any errors in the URL or settings.

4.Disable a Specific Repo in Configuration: If you no longer need the repository or it’s permanently unavailable, you can disable it by setting enabled=0 in the corresponding .repo file inside /etc/yum.repos.d/. For example:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/your-repo-name.repo
Look for the enabled option and set it to 0:
bash
Copy code
enabled=0

5. check Internet Connectivity: Sometimes this issue occurs due to network connectivity problems. Ensure that your machine has an active internet connection.

6.Try Running Yum with Debug Information: To get more information on what's going wrong, you can try running the following command to see detailed logs:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum -v update

7. Rebuild the Yum Cache: After resolving the repository issue or fixing the configuration file, you can rebuild the cache:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum makecache

8. Check for Proxy Issues: If you're behind a proxy, ensure that Yum is configured to use it. You can configure proxy settings in /etc/yum.conf:
bash
Copy code
proxy=http://<proxy-server>:<port>
proxy_username=<your-username>
proxy_password=<your-password>
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the repository issue causing Yum to fail.

Could not retrieve mirrorlist http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&arch=x86_64&repo=os&infra=stock error was 14: curl#6 - "Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error" 

The error message Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error indicates that your system is unable to resolve the domain name of the CentOS mirrorlist server. This is usually a DNS issue or a problem with network connectivity.
Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1.Check Network Connectivity:
Ensure that your machine has internet access. You can check this by trying to ping a known address:
bash
Copy code
ping google.com
If this fails, you might have a network issue (cable, Wi-Fi, etc.). Ensure your network is properly configured.

2.Check DNS Configuration:
The error is related to DNS (Domain Name System) resolution, so you should check your DNS settings. You can test DNS resolution by trying to resolve the CentOS mirrorlist manually:
bash
Copy code
nslookup mirrorlist.centos.org
If this fails, your system's DNS configuration might be incorrect.
You can temporarily change or add a public DNS server like Google's DNS:
• Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and add the following lines:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
Add:
bash
Copy code
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
Save and exit. This should make DNS resolution work using Google's public DNS servers.

3. Restart Network Services:
If your DNS settings are correct but you're still having issues, try restarting your network services:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart network

4. Check /etc/hosts File:
Ensure that the /etc/hosts file doesn't have incorrect entries that could interfere with DNS resolution. You can check this by opening the file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/hosts
Make sure there are no conflicting entries for mirrorlist.centos.org or any other mirror-related hosts.

5. Check for Proxy Settings:
If you're behind a proxy, ensure that the proxy is correctly configured. Sometimes yum and curl may not work behind a proxy unless explicitly configured. If you are behind a proxy, configure it in /etc/yum.conf:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.conf
Add these lines (if they are not already present):
bash
Copy code
proxy=http://<proxy-server>:<port>
proxy_username=<your-username>
proxy_password=<your-password>

6.Disable the FastestMirror Plugin (if enabled):
The FastestMirror plugin could cause issues if it has trouble connecting to certain mirrors. You can disable it in the yum configuration:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/fastestmirror.conf
Set enabled=0 to disable it:
bash
Copy code
enabled=0

7.Manually Set BaseURL in Repos (Temporary Fix):
If you are unable to retrieve the mirrorlist, you can manually set the baseurl in the repository configuration file as a workaround. You can do this in /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo by commenting out the mirrorlist line and manually adding a specific mirror URL under the [base] section. For example:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo
Comment out the mirrorlist line and add:
ini
Copy code
#mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=os&infra=$infra
baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/centos/$releasever/os/$basearch/
Save and exit.

8.Flush DNS Cache:
Sometimes the DNS cache might have stale entries. You can flush the DNS cache by restarting the systemd-resolved service:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
After performing these steps, try running yum again:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum update
If DNS or connectivity was the issue, this should resolve it.

Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base/7/x86_64 


The error Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base/7/x86_64 indicates that yum is unable to locate the base repository for CentOS 7, typically because of network issues, repository misconfiguration, or problems with DNS resolution.
Here are steps to troubleshoot and fix this issue:

1.Verify Network Connectivity
First, make sure your system has internet access:
bash
Copy code
ping google.com
If you can't ping external websites, check your network settings or verify that your machine is connected to the internet.

2.Check DNS Settings
If your network connection is fine but yum still can't find the baseurl, check if DNS resolution is working properly:
bash
Copy code
nslookup mirror.centos.org
If this fails, it indicates a DNS problem.
You can temporarily fix DNS issues by adding public DNS servers like Google's to /etc/resolv.conf:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
Add the following:
bash
Copy code
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
Save and exit.

3.Manually Edit the Repository File
The CentOS repository configuration files are stored in /etc/yum.repos.d/. You can manually edit the CentOS Base repository configuration to ensure that the URLs are correct:
Open the CentOS Base repository file:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo
In the [base], [updates], and [extras] sections, comment out the mirrorlist line and manually set the baseurl to point to the main CentOS mirror:
ini
Copy code
#mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=os&infra=$infra
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/os/$basearch/
Make similar changes for other sections like [updates]:
ini
Copy code
#mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=updates&infra=$infra
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/updates/$basearch/
For [extras]:
ini
Copy code
#mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=extras&infra=$infra
baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/extras/$basearch/
Save the file after making these changes.

4.Clear Yum Cache
After making repository changes, clear the yum cache to ensure it fetches fresh data:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum makecache

5.Disable FastestMirror Plugin
If the fastestmirror plugin is enabled, it may cause issues resolving the baseurl. You can disable it by editing the plugin configuration:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/fastestmirror.conf
Set enabled=0:
ini
Copy code
enabled=0

6.Verify the Base URL is Reachable
Try accessing the base URL directly via curl or wget to make sure it is reachable:
bash
Copy code
curl http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/
If this works, the problem is resolved.

7.Check Proxy Settings
If you're behind a proxy, ensure that Yum is configured to use it. You can set proxy settings in /etc/yum.conf:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/yum.conf
Add the following lines (if applicable):
ini
Copy code
proxy=http://<proxy-server>:<port>
proxy_username=<your-username>
proxy_password=<your-password>

8. Use CentOS Vault (if applicable)
If you are working with an older or archived version of CentOS, it's possible that the mirrors are no longer active, and you will need to use the CentOS Vault. Replace the mirrorlist in the repo file with baseurl lines pointing to the Vault as mentioned in Step 3.
Once you've made the appropriate changes, run yum update again:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum update
