for host in cat remohsots; do echo $host;done

This command is a bash shell loop used to iterate through a list of items (in this case, hostnames) that are stored in a file called remohsots. Here's a breakdown:

for host in `cat remohsots`:

This part of the loop reads the file remohsots using the cat command, which outputs its contents.
The backticks `` around cat remohsots capture the output of this command and provide it as a list to the for loop. Each line (or space-separated item) in the file is treated as an individual value, and the variable host is set to each value one by one.
do echo $host:

This part of the loop is the action performed for each value of host. In this case, it simply echoes (prints) the value of host to the terminal.
done:

This marks the end of the loop.
Example:
Assume the file remohsots contains the following lines:

Copy code
host1
host2
host3
The command will output:

Copy code
host1
host2
host3
What It Does:
The loop reads each hostname from the remohsots file, assigns it to the variable host, and prints each hostname on a new line.
